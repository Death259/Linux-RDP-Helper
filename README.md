# Linux RDP Helper
This project was originally meant to help get everything setup in order to be able to connect to windows machines via RDP. This has since grown to be a complete initial setup script for a Linux installation. My hope is that you can install a fresh copy of linux and use this to get most everything setup.

This script has been tested on Fedora 28, Ubuntu Mate 18.04 and Linux Mint 19.
